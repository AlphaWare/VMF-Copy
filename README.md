# VMF-Copy
Read materials in a Hammer .vmf file and copy the material file and texture file from the game's directory or a custom folder and copy them into another folder, such as a GMod Workshop addon.

If it's possible, support for sounds and models should be added.

This would make working with custom content alot easier to release.
